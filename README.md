# bootstrap

NOTE: This is a primarily private repo (read: unlikely I will answer any support requests) that is kept public so I can easily access it on new computers.

This is a script that is meant to be run on a new computer. It will attempt to install a package manager, then install a pre-defined list of packages, and then finally clone my personal dotfiles and run the installation for it.
